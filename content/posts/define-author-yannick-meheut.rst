Hi everyone!

My name is Yannick, I'm a 22 year-old student at the French engineer
school Télécom ParisTech. I study cryptography and info/netsec. Although
I find these topics fascinating, I'm pretty new to this world.

Last month, I decided to participate to the Stripe CTF, and,
unexpectedly, I managed to capture the flag, yay! I chose to create a
blog to post my write-ups, to leave a trace of my participation, and
later post news from the info/netsec world.

Hope you have a nice time,

Cheers.
